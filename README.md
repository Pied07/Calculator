# Calculator
A Simple Calculator using HTML, CSS, JS

Just a demo calculator

Main purpose of building this is to show the basic working of java script.

It is not responsive, so it might not look good enough on phone, sorry for that.

Since this is just a sample demo working of java script, so I didn't gave much time on cascade styling...
